# Reinforcement Learning

## Comparing and contrasting learning
	* review of supervised learning
	* review of unsupervised learning
	* introduction to reinforcement learning

## Reinforcement Learning Basics
	* Types of reinforcement learning (simple examples of each)
		* policy gradient learning
		* Q learning
		* other examples
	* Typical architecture of Reinforcement Learning (example project w/ one of the above types of RL)
		* typical functions that are defined
		* typical project layout

## Reinforcement Learning in Gaming
	* Reinforcement learning with supervised learning algorithms (worked example) (maybe)
	* Deep Q-Learning
	* Deep neural networks with policy gradient learning
	* AlphaGo example

## Reinforcement Learning in Decision making
	* Timeseries decision making
	* Robotics
	* Computation
